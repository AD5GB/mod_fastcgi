There are a lot of differences between Apache 1.2 and 1.3.  The 
introduction of Sigfunc typedef was one of those, ap_md5() function
was another.  I was thinking of providing some sort of a layer to
allow running of the same code for both 1.2, 1.3 and possibly further
up versions.

Future note: Apache currently does not protect you from the multiple
inclusion of the header files using #ifndef HEADER_FILE stuff, so I am
forced to include "conf.h" into 4 files (3 explicitly and 1 using 
httpd.h). There are probably other files that needs such inclusions, so
I am marking the code as /* apache code */, so that someone may change it
later to include one file (need to wait till apache 2.0, i guess)

After the patches, my version of mod_fastcgi mostly works for dynamic
applications.  There is a race condition I haven't figured out how to
fix yet.  The process manager sometimes kills an application process
that either apache is currently using to handle a request, or apache
has just chosen to use (based on a lock file existing) but hasn't yet
tried to contact (with connect()).  This results in a "500 Server
Error"; I see it about 1 in every 20 FastCGI requests when using
FCGIConfig parameters that kill processes rather aggressively.

The other bug I haven't fixed yet is that if the server is not
extremely busy, and the FastCGI applications don't take a long time to
process requests, almost any set of FCGIConfig parameters results in
short application lifetimes (less than 3 minutes), because the
calculated load is almost always less than 1, on a scale of 0-100.
I'm considering adding a logarithmic weighting to the load, but
haven't figured out how yet.
