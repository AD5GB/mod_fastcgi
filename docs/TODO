 *) External (not created by web server) process manager.  This would
	allow for alternate implementation of the killing policy, other mechanics,
	OS specific stuff, etc.

 *) Port the module to WindowsNT.

 *) Implement a separate timeout for the communication with the FastCGI
	application.  At present mod_fastcgi's timeout is for the
	communication with the client.  A much shorter timeout would often be
	appropriate for the communication with the FastCGI application.  One
	difficulty is that mod_fastcgi often interleaves client and
	application communication.

 *) Implement session affinity.  The issue here is where to get
	session information from.  Apache doesn't handle this in a
	standard way and there's no way to customize short of writing
	C code to link into the server.  (Authorizer role would
	allow the session-identifying code to run outside the server.)
	Is it possible to use mod_unique_id to set/get identifiers to be used
	in implementing session affinity ???.
