 *) External (not created by web server) process manager.  This would
	allow for alternate implementation of the killing policy, other mechanics,
	OS specific stuff, etc.

 *) Port the module to WindowsNT.

 *) Implement a separate timeout for the communication with the FastCGI
	application.  At present mod_fastcgi's timeout is for the
	communication with the client.  A much shorter timeout would often be
	appropriate for the communication with the FastCGI application.  One
	difficulty is that mod_fastcgi often interleaves client and
	application communication.

 *) Implement session affinity.  Is it possible to use mod_unique_id to set/get
    identifiers to be used in implementing session affinity?
    
 *) Support an -appConnTimeout value which would indicate that the connection
    should not be put in non-blocking mode.
    
 *) Configurable buffer sizes.
