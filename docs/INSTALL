>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> INSTALLATION <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

	This file provides simple to follow instructions on how to install
and compile the fastcgi module.  After you have installed the Apache web
server (versions 1.2 and up), perform the following operation:

% ./tools/fcgi_install.sh $apache_root_directory

	The $apache_root_directory is the directory in which Apache web 
server was installed (if no argument is specified, /usr/local/apache is
used).  This program will determine what version of the Apache web server
you have and will install the module into proper subdirectory.  It will 
also alter the Configuration file supplied by the Apache and add the
support for FastCGI protocol, however it will NOT enable it.  After the
installation, you may remove fastcgi module distribution.

	In order to compile the module into the Apache web server, you will
need to manually edit Configuration file to uncomment the line enabling 
the FastCGI module.  Then, perform the following operations:

% cd $apache_root_directory
% ./Configure
% ./Make
