<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">Module mod_fastcgi</h1>

<p>This 3<sup>rd</sup> party module provides support for the FastCGI protocol. &nbsp;
FastCGI is a language independent, scalable, open extension to CGI that provides high
performance and persistence without the limitations of server specific APIs.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications are not limited to a particular development language (the protocol
is open).&nbsp; FastCGI application libraries currently exist for Perl, C/C++, Java, Python,
and TCL.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications use (TCP or Unix) sockets to communicate with the web server.
&nbsp;This scalable architecture allows applications to run on the same platform as the
web server or on many machines scattered across an enterprise network.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications are portable to other web server platforms.&nbsp; FastCGI is
supported either directly or through commercial extensions by most popular web servers.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications are fast because they're persistent.&nbsp; There is no per-request
startup and initialization overhead.&nbsp; This makes possible the development of
applications which would otherwise be impractical within the CGI paradigm (e.g. a huge
Perl script, or an application which requires a connection to one or more databases).
&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>For information about building and installing the module, see the <a href="../INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
document that came with the distribution.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications under <code>mod_fastcgi</code> are defined as one of three types:
static, dynamic, or external.&nbsp; They're configured using the <a href="#fastcgiserver">FastCgiServer</a>,
<a href="#FastCgiConfig">FastCgiConfig</a>, and <a href="#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</a>
<a href="#directives">directives</a> respectively.&nbsp; Any URI that Apache identifies as
a FastCGI application and which hasn't been explicitly configured using a <a
href="#fastcgiserver">FastCgiServer</a> or <a href="#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</a>
directive is handled as a dynamic application (see the <a href="#FastCgiConfig">FastCgiConfig</a>
directive for more information).</p>

<p>FastCGI static and dynamic applications are spawned and managed by the FastCGI Process
Manager, fcgi-pm.&nbsp; The process manager is spawned by Apache at server initialization.
&nbsp; External applications are presumed to be started and managed independently.</p>

<p>Apache must be configured to identify requests for FastCGI URIs.&nbsp; <code>mod_fastcgi</code>
registers (with Apache) a handler type of <code>fastcgi-script</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>To configure Apache to handle all files (within the scope of the directive) as FastCGI
applications (e.g. for a fcgi-bin directory):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code><a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#sethandler">SetHandler</a>
  fastcgi-script</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To configure Apache to handle files (within the scope of&nbsp; the directive) with
the specified extension(s) as FastCGI applications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code><a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler">AddHandler</a>
  fastcgi-script fcg fcgi fpl</code></p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
  <p>Consult the Apache documentation for more information regarding these and other
  directives which affect request handling (such as <code><a
  href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_actions.html#action">Action</a>).</code></p>
  <p>Dynamic FastCGI applications require the <code>ExecCGI</code> option be enabled
  (see the <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#options"><code>Options</code></a> 
  directive) in the
  application's directory.&nbsp; </p>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p><code>mod_fastcgi</code> logs FastCGI application error (stderr) output to the server
  log associated with the request.&nbsp; Errors reported by the FastCGI process manager,
  fcgi-pm, are reported to the main server log (typically, logs/error_log).&nbsp;
  Data written to stdout or stderr before entering the FastCGI <em>accept</em>
  loop or via a mechanism that is not FastCGI protocol aware will also be
  directed to the main server log.&nbsp; If
  Apache's <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#loglevel"><code>LogLevel</code></a>
  is set to <code>info</code> additional informational messages are printed to the
  logs, these messages may be especially helpful while debugging a
  configuration..</p>
  <p>To pass per-request environment variables to FastCGI applications, have a look at: <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_env.html"><code>mod_env</code></a> (<code>SetEnv</code>,
  <code>PassEnv</code>, <code>UnSetEnv</code>), <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_setenvif.html"><code>mod_setenvif</code></a> (<code>BrowserMatch</code>,
  <code>BrowserMatchNoCase</code>, <code>SetEnvIf</code>, <code>SetEnvIfNoCase</code>), and <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html"><code>mod_rewrite</code></a> (if
  your feeling adventurous).</p>
  <p>FastCGI application output is buffered by default.&nbsp; This is not the case for CGI
  scripts (under Apache 1.3).&nbsp; To override the default behavior, use the -flush
  option.&nbsp; Non-parsed header (nph-) scripts will be rejected by mod_fastcgi
  simply as
  warning the behavior is different (create a symbolic link to the script without the
  &quot;nph-&quot; prefix if this poses a problem).</p>
  <p>Redirects are handled similar to CGI.&nbsp; Location headers with values that begin
  with &quot;/&quot; are treated as internal-redirects; otherwise, they are treated as
  external redirects (302).</p>
  <p>Session affinity (as well as distribution) should be achievable outside of <code>mod_fastcgi</code>
  using <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html"><code>mod_rewrite</code></a>.&nbsp; If you get this working, please post the details to <a
  href="mailto:fastcgi-developers@idle.com">fastcgi-developers@idle.com</a> so they can be
  included here.</p>
  <h2>FastCGI Specification Compliance</h2>
  <p>The FastCGI specification is not implemented in its entirety and I've deviated a bit as
  well resulting in some Apache specific features.</p>
  <p>The file descriptors for stdout and stderr are left open.&nbsp; This is
  prohibited by the specification.&nbsp; I can't see any reason to require that
  they be closed, and leaving them open prevents FastCGI applications which were
  not completely ported to FastCGI from failing miserably.&nbsp; This does not
  mean the applications shouldn't be fixed such that this doesn't occur, but is
  invaluable when using a 3rd party library (without source code) which expects
  to be able to write to stderr.&nbsp; Anything written to stdout or stderr in
  this manner will be directed to the main server log.</p>
  <p>The Filter and Log Roles are not supported.&nbsp; The Filter Role has
  little value in
  Apache until the output of one handler can be piped into another (Apache 2.0 is expected
  to support this).&nbsp; The Log Role has some value, but Apache's &quot;piped
  logs&quot; feature is similar (and is even more CPU friendly). </p>
  <p>Multiplexed requests are not supported. &nbsp; This does NOT mean FastCGI
  applications can't be multithreaded.&nbsp; It means that each request requires
  its own independent connect()/accept().&nbsp; The protocol supports the concept of a
  connection simultaneously shared by multiple requests.&nbsp; The FastCGI application
  library which provides the FastCGI protocol support within FastCGI applications does not
  currently support it (and thus doesn't have to be supported here).&nbsp; This may become a
  higher priority when <code>mod_fastcgi</code> is ported to NT (Apache is threaded on
  NT which makes shared persistent multiplexed connection more reasonable to
  consider).&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Authorizer Role has three variations corresponding to each three
  specific Apache request handling phases:&nbsp; Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control.
  &nbsp; <code>mod_fastcgi</code> sets up the (Apache specific) environment variable
  &quot;FCGI_APACHE_ROLE&quot; to indicate which Apache authorizer phase is being performed.</p>
  <p><code>mod_fastcgi</code> sends nearly all of the standard environment variables
  typically available to CGI/FastCGI request handlers including some explicitly precluded by
  the FastCGI specification; I didn't see the point to leaving them out.&nbsp; All headers
  returned by a FastCGI authentication application in a successful response (Status: 200)
  are passed to subprocesses (CGI/FastCGI invocations) as environment variables rather than
  just those prefixed by &quot;<code>Variable-</code>&quot; as the FastCGI specification
  calls for; I didn't see the point in leaving them out either.&nbsp; FastCGI specification
  compliant authorizer behavior can be obtained by using the &quot;<code>-compat</code>&quot;
  option to the Auth server directives.</p>
  <p>Custom failure responses from FastCGI authorizer applications are not
  supported (speak up if you need this).&nbsp; See the <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#errordocument">ErrorDocument</a>
  directive for a workaround (hint: a CGI/FastCGI application can serve the
  error document).</p>

  </p>
  <p>By default, the Process Manager will start one instance of the application with the

    used.&nbsp; Blocking <code>connect()</code>s have an OS dependent internal
    timeout<code>.&nbsp; </code>If the timeout expires, a&nbsp; SERVER_ERROR results.&nbsp; For
    non-zero values, this is the amount of time used in a <code>select()</code>

    the application doesn't respond (by writing and flushing) within this
    period, the request will be aborted.&nbsp; If communication is complete with

    &quot;=&quot; without any value.&nbsp; The option can be used repeatedly.</dd>
  <dt><code><b>-init-start-delay <em>n</b>&nbsp;</em>(1 second)</code></dt>
  <dd>The minimum number of seconds between the spawning of instances of this application.
    &nbsp; This delay decreases the demand placed on the system at server initialization.</dd>
  <dt><code><strong>-flush</strong>&nbsp;<em>none</em></code></dt>

    with the web server.&nbsp; The module creates the socket within the directory specified by
    <code>FastCgiIpcDir</code>.&nbsp; This option makes the application accessible to other
    applications (e.g. <code>cgi-fcgi</code>) on the same machine or via an external FastCGI
    application definition (<code>FastCgiExternalServer</code>).&nbsp; If neither the <code>-socket</code>

    application is lower than the specified threshold, the last instance is terminated. &nbsp;
    In order to make your executables run in the &quot;idle&quot; mode for the long time, you
    would specify value closer to 1, however if memory or CPU time is of primary concern, a
    value closer to 100 would be more applicable.&nbsp; A value of 0 will
    prevent the last instance of an application from being terminated; this is

  <p>When <code>FastCgiSuexec</code> is enabled, the location of static or external FastCGI
  application definitions is important.&nbsp; They inherit their user and group from the <code>User</code>
  and <code>Group</code> directives in the virtual server in which they were defined.&nbsp; <code>User</code>
  and <code>Group</code> directives should precede FastCGI application definitions. &nbsp;
  Note that this does <em>not</em> limit the FastCGI application to the virtual server in
  which they were defined, the application is allowed to service requests from any virtual
  server with the same user and group.&nbsp; If a request is received for a FastCGI
  application without an existing matching definition running with the correct user and
  group, a dynamic instance of the application is started with the correct user and group.
  &nbsp; This can lead to multiple copies of the same application running with different
  user/group.&nbsp; If this is a problem, preclude navigation to the application from other
  virtual servers or configure the virtual servers with the same User and Group.</p>
