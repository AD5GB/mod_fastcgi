<h1 ALIGN="center">Module mod_fastcgi</h1>

<p>This 3<sup>rd</sup> party module provides support for the FastCGI protocol.
FastCGI is a language independent, scalable, open extension to CGI that provides high
performance and persistence without the limitations of server specific APIs.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications are not limited to a particular development language (the protocol
is open). FastCGI application libraries currently exist for Perl, C/C++, Java, Python,
and TCL.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications use (TCP or Unix) sockets to communicate with the web server.
This scalable architecture allows applications to run on the same platform as the
web server or on many machines scattered across an enterprise network.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications are portable to other web server platforms. FastCGI is
supported either directly or through commercial extensions by most popular web servers.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications are fast because they're persistent. There is no per-request
startup and initialization overhead. This makes possible the development of
applications which would otherwise be impractical within the CGI paradigm (e.g. a huge
Perl script, or an application which requires a connection to one or more databases).
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>For information about building and installing the module, see the <A href="../INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
document that came with the distribution.</p>

<p>FastCGI applications under <code>mod_fastcgi</code> are defined as one of three types:
static, dynamic, or external. They're configured using the <A href="#fastcgiserver">FastCgiServer</a>,
<A href="#FastCgiConfig">FastCgiConfig</a>, and <A href="#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</a>
<A href="#directives">directives</a> respectively. Any URI that Apache identifies as
a FastCGI application and which hasn't been explicitly configured using a
<A href="#fastcgiserver" >FastCgiServer</a> or <A href="#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</a>
directive is handled as a dynamic application (see the <A href="#FastCgiConfig">FastCgiConfig</a>
directive for more information).</p>

<p>FastCGI static and dynamic applications are spawned and managed by the FastCGI Process
Manager, fcgi-pm. The process manager is spawned by Apache at server initialization.
External applications are presumed to be started and managed independently.</p>

<p>Apache must be configured to identify requests for FastCGI URIs. <code>mod_fastcgi</code>
registers (with Apache) a handler type of <code>fastcgi-script</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>To configure Apache to handle all files (within the scope of the directive) as FastCGI
applications (e.g. for a fcgi-bin directory):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code><a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#sethandler">SetHandler</a>
  fastcgi-script</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To configure Apache to handle files (within the scope of the directive) with
the specified extension(s) as FastCGI applications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code><a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler">AddHandler</a>
  fastcgi-script fcg fcgi fpl</code></p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
  <p>Consult the Apache documentation for more information regarding these and other
  directives which affect request handling (such as <code>
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_actions.html#action">Action</a>).</code></p>
  <p>Dynamic FastCGI applications require the <code>ExecCGI</code> option be enabled
  (see the <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#options"><code>Options</code></a> 
  directive) in the application's directory.</p>
  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p><code>mod_fastcgi</code> logs FastCGI application error (stderr) output to the server
  log associated with the request. Errors reported by the FastCGI process manager,
  fcgi-pm, are reported to the main server log (typically, logs/error_log).
  Data written to stdout or stderr before entering the FastCGI <em>accept</em>
  loop or via a mechanism that is not FastCGI protocol aware will also be
  directed to the main server log. If
  Apache's <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#loglevel"><code>LogLevel</code></a>
  is set to <code>info</code> additional informational messages are printed to the
  logs, these messages may be especially helpful while debugging a
  configuration..</p>
  <p>To pass per-request environment variables to FastCGI applications, have a look at:
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_env.html"><code>mod_env</code></a>
  (<code>SetEnv</code>, <code>PassEnv</code>, <code>UnSetEnv</code>),
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_setenvif.html"><code>mod_setenvif</code></a>
  (<code>BrowserMatch</code>, <code>BrowserMatchNoCase</code>, <code>SetEnvIf</code>,
  <code>SetEnvIfNoCase</code>), and
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html"><code>mod_rewrite</code></a> (if
  you're feeling adventurous).</p>
  <p>FastCGI application output is buffered by default. This is not the case for CGI
  scripts (under Apache 1.3). To override the default behavior, use the <code>-flush</code>
  option (not available for dynamic applications). Non-parsed header (nph-) scripts will be rejected by mod_fastcgi simply as
  warning the behavior is different (create a symbolic link to the script without the
  "nph-" prefix if this poses a problem).</p>
  <p>Redirects are handled similarly to CGI. Location headers with values that begin
  with "/" are treated as internal-redirects; otherwise, they are treated as
  external redirects (302).</p>
  <p>Session affinity (as well as distribution) should be achievable outside of <code>mod_fastcgi</code>
  using <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html"><code>mod_rewrite</code></a>.
  If you get this working, please post the details to
  <A href="mailto:fastcgi-developers@fastcgi.com">fastcgi-developers@fastcgi.com</a>
  so they can be included here.</p>
  <h2>FastCGI Specification Compliance</h2>
  <p>The FastCGI specification is not implemented in its entirety and I've deviated a bit as
  well resulting in some Apache specific features.</p>
  <p>The file descriptors for stdout and stderr are left open. This is
  prohibited by the specification. I can't see any reason to require that
  they be closed, and leaving them open prevents FastCGI applications which were
  not completely ported to FastCGI from failing miserably. This does not
  mean the applications shouldn't be fixed such that this doesn't occur, but is
  invaluable when using a 3<sup>rd</sup> party library (without source code) which expects
  to be able to write to stderr. Anything written to stdout or stderr in
  this manner will be directed to the main server log.</p>
  <p>The Filter and Log Roles are not supported. The Filter Role has
  little value in
  Apache until the output of one handler can be piped into another (Apache 2.0 is expected
  to support this). The Log Role has some value, but Apache's "piped
  logs" feature is similar (and is even more CPU friendly). </p>
  <p>Multiplexed requests are not supported. This does NOT mean FastCGI
  applications can't be multithreaded. It means that each request requires
  its own independent connect()/accept(). The protocol supports the concept of a
  connection simultaneously shared by multiple requests. The FastCGI application
  library which provides the FastCGI protocol support within FastCGI applications does not
  currently support it (and thus doesn't have to be supported here). This may become a
  higher priority when <code>mod_fastcgi</code> is ported to NT (Apache is threaded on
  NT which makes shared persistent multiplexed connection more reasonable to
  consider).</p>
  <p>The Authorizer Role has three variations corresponding to each three
  specific Apache request handling phases:&nbsp; Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control.
  <code>mod_fastcgi</code> sets up the (Apache specific) environment variable
  "FCGI_APACHE_ROLE" to indicate which Apache authorizer phase is being performed.</p>
  <p><code>mod_fastcgi</code> sends nearly all of the standard environment variables
  typically available to CGI/FastCGI request handlers including some explicitly precluded by
  the FastCGI specification; I didn't see the point in leaving them out. All headers
  returned by a FastCGI authentication application in a successful response (Status: 200)
  are passed to sub-processes (CGI/FastCGI invocations) as environment variables rather than
  just those prefixed by <code>Variable-</code> as the FastCGI specification
  calls for; I didn't see the point in leaving them out either. FastCGI specification
  compliant authorizer behavior can be obtained by using the <code>-compat</code>
  option to the Auth server directives.</p>
  <p>Custom failure responses from FastCGI authorizer applications are not
  supported (speak up if you need this). See the <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#errordocument">ErrorDocument</a>
  directive for a workaround (hint: a CGI/FastCGI application can serve the
  error document).</p>

  <p>The <code>FastCgiServer</code> directive defines <em>filename</em> as a static FastCGI
  application. If the filename does not begin with a slash (/) then it is assumed to
  be relative to the <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</a>.
  </p>
  <p>By default, the Process Manager will start one instance of the application with the
  default configuration specified (in parentheses) below. Should a static application
  instance die for any reason <code>mod_fastcgi</code> will spawn another to replace it and
  log the event (at the <code>warn</code> <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#loglevel"><code>LogLevel</code></a>).</p>
  <p><em>Option</em> can be one of (case insensitive):</p>

  <dt><code><b>-appConnTimeout <em>n</em></b> (0 seconds)</code>
  <dd><b>Unix:&nbsp;</b>The number of seconds to wait for a connection to the FastCGI application to
    complete or 0 to indicate a blocking <code>connect()</code> should be
    used. Blocking <code>connect()</code>s have an OS dependent internal
    timeout<code>. </code>If the timeout expires, a SERVER_ERROR results. For
    non-zero values, this is the amount of time used in a <code>select()</code> 
    to write to the file descriptor returned by a non-blocking
    <code>connect().</code> Non-blocking <code>connect()</code>s are troublesome
    on many platforms. See also <code>-idle-timeout</code>, it produces similar results
    but in a more portable manner.<br>
 <b>Windows NT:&nbsp;</b>TCP based applications work as above. Named pipe based 
  applications (static applications configured without the <code>-port</code> option and 
  dynamic applications) use this value successfully to limit the amount of time 
  to wait for a connection (i.e. it's not "troublesome"). By default, this 
  is 90 seconds (FCGI_NAMED_PIPE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT in mod_fastcgi.h). 

  <dt><code><b>-idle-timeout <em>n</em></b> (30 seconds)</code>
  <dd>The number of seconds of FastCGI application inactivity allowed before the
    request is aborted and the event is logged (at the <code>error</code> <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#loglevel"><code>LogLevel</code></a>). 
  The inactivity timer applies only as long as a connection is pending with the 
  FastCGI application. If a request is queued to an application, but the 
  application doesn't respond (by writing and flushing) within this period, the 
  request will be aborted. If communication is complete with the 
  application but incomplete with the client (the response is buffered), the 
  timeout does not apply. 

  <dt><code><b>-initial-env <em>name[=[value]]</em></b> (none)</code>
  <dd>A name-value pair to be passed in the FastCGI application's <i>initial</i> environment. To 
  pass a variable from Apache's environment, don't provide the "=" (if the 
  variable isn't actually in the environment, it will be defined without a 
  value). To define a variable without a value, provide the "=" without 
  any value. The option can be used repeatedly. 

  <dt><code><b>-init-start-delay <em>n</em></b> (1 second)</code>
  <dd>The minimum number of seconds between the spawning of 
  instances of this application. This delay decreases the demand placed 
  on the system at server initialization. 

  <dt><code><b>-flush</b> (none)</code>
  <dd>Force a write to the client as data is received from the application. By default, <code>mod_fastcgi</code> buffers data in order to free the 
  application as quickly as possible. 

  <dt><code><b>-listen-queue-depth <em>n</em></b> (100)</code>
  <dd>The depth of <code>listen()</code> queue (also known as the 
  backlog) shared by all of the instances of this application. A deeper 
  listen queue allows the server to cope with transient load fluctuations 
  without rejecting requests; it does not increase throughput. Adding 
  additional application instances may increase throughput/performance, 
  depending upon the application and the host. 

  <dt><code><b>-pass-header <em>header</em></b> (none)</code>
  <dd>The name of an HTTP Request Header to be passed in the <i>request</i> environment. This option makes 
  available the contents of headers which are normally not available (e.g. 
  Authorization) to a CGI environment. 

  <dt><code><b>-port <em>n</em></b> (none)</code>
  <dd>The TCP port number (1-65535) the application will use for communication with the web
    server. This option makes the application accessible from other machines on the
    network (as well as this one). The <code>-socket</code> and <code>-port</code> options are mutually exclusive. 

  <dt><code><b>-priority <em>n</em></b> (0)</code>
  <dd>The process priority to be assigned to the application instances (using <code>setpriority()</code>). 

  <dt><code><b>-processes <em>n</em></b> (1)</code>
  <dd>The number of instances of the application to spawn 
  at server initialization. 

  <dt><code><b>-restart-delay <em>n</em></b> (5 seconds)</code>
  <dd>The minimum number of seconds between the respawning 
  of failed instances of this application. This delay prevents a broken 
  application from soaking up too much of the system. 

  <dt><code><b>-socket <em>filename</em></b> (generated)</code>
  <dd><b>Unix:&nbsp</b>The filename of the Unix domain socket that the application will use for communication
    with the web server. The module creates the socket within the directory specified by
    <code><A href="#FastCgiIpcDir">FastCgiIpcDir</A></code>. This option makes the application accessible to other
    applications (e.g. <code>cgi-fcgi</code>) on the same machine or via an external FastCGI
    application definition (<code><A href="#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</A></code>). If neither the <code>-socket</code>
    nor the <code>-port</code> options are given, the module generates a Unix domain socket
    filename. The <code>-socket</code> and <code>-port</code> options are mutually exclusive. 
  
<DD>
<B>Windows NT:&nbsp</B>The name of the named pipe that the application will
use for communication with the web server. The module creates the
named pipe under the named pipe root specified by <code><A href="#FastCgiIpcDir">FastCgiIpcDir</A></code>.
This option makes the application accessible to other applications (e.g.
<code>cgi-fcgi</code>) on the same machine or via an external FastCGI application
definition (<code><A href="#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</A></code>). If neither the <code>-socket</code>
nor the <code>-port</code> options are given, the module generates a name for
the named pipe. The <code>-socket</code> and <code>-port</code> options are
mutually exclusive.</DD>

  <p>The <code>FastCgiConfig</code> directive defines the default parameters for 
    <i>all</i> dynamic FastCGI applications. This directive does not affect static 
    or external applications in any way.</p>
  <p>Dynamic applications are not started at server initialization, but upon demand. 
    If the demand is heavy, additional application instances are started. As the 
    demand fades, application instances are killed off. Many of the options govern 
    this process.</p>
  <p><em>Option</em> can be one of (case insensitive):</p>

  <dt><code><b>-autoUpdate</b> (none)</code> 
  <dd>Causes mod_fastcgi to check the modification time of the application on 
    disk before processing each request. If the application on disk has been changed, 
    the process manager is notified and all running instances of the application 
    are killed off. In general, it's preferred that this type of functionality 
    be built-in to the application (e.g. every 100th request it checks to see 
    if there's a newer version on disk and exits if so). There may be an outstanding 
    problem (bug) when this option is used with <code>-restart</code>. 
  <dt><code><b>-flush</b> (none)</code> 
  <dd>Force a write to the client as data is received from the application. By 
    default, <code>mod_fastcgi</code> buffers data in order to free the application 
    as quickly as possible. 
  <dt><code><b>-gainValue <em>n</em></b> (0.5)</code> 
  <dd>A floating point value between 0 and 1 used as an exponent in the computation 
    of the exponentially decayed connection times load factor of the currently 
    running dynamic FastCGI applications. Old values are scaled by (<code>1&nbsp;-&nbsp;gainValue</code>), 
    so making it smaller weights old values more than the current value (which 
    is scaled by <code>gainValue</code>). 
  <dt><code><b>-idle-timeout <em>n</em></b> (30 seconds)</code> 
  <dd>The number of seconds of FastCGI application inactivity allowed before the 
    request is aborted and the event is logged (at the <code>error</code> <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#loglevel"><code>LogLevel</code></a>).

    but incomplete with the client (the response is buffered), the timeout does 
    not apply. 
  <dt><code><b>-initial-env <em>name[=[value]]</EM></b> (none)</code> 
  <dd>A name-value pair to be passed in the initial environment when instances 
    of applications are spawned. To pass a variable from the Apache environment, 
    don't provide the "=" (if the variable isn't actually in the environment, 
    it will be defined without a value). To define a variable without a value, 
    provide the "=" without any value. The option can be used repeatedly. 
  <dt><code><b>-init-start-delay <em>n</em></b> (1 second)</code>

    policy, larger numbers a less aggressive policy. 
  <dt><code><b>-listen-queue-depth <em>n</em></b> (100)</code>

    by all instances of applications. A deeper listen queue allows the server 
    to cope with transient load fluctuations without rejecting requests; it does 
    not increase throughput. Adding additional application instances may increase 
    throughput/performance, depending upon the application and the host.

  <dd>The maximum total number of dynamic FastCGI application instances allowed

  <dt><code><b>-minProcesses <em>n</em></b> (5)</code> 
  <dd>The minimum total number of dynamic FastCGI application instances allowed 
    to run at any one time without being killed off by the process manager (due 
    to lack of demand). 
  <dt><code><b>-multiThreshold <em>n</em></b> (50)</code> 
  <dd>An integer between 0 and 100 used to determine whether any one instance 
    of a FastCGI application should be terminated. If the application has more 
    than one instance currently running, this attribute will be used to decide 
    whether one of them should be terminated. If only one instance remains, <code>singleThreshold</code> 
    is used instead. <br>
    For historic reasons the mis-spelling <code>multiThreshhold</code> is also 
    accepted. 
  <dt><code><b>-pass-header <em>header</em></b> (none)</code>

    This option makes available the contents of headers which are normally not 
    available (e.g. Authorization) to a CGI environment. 
  <dt><code><b>-priority <em>n</em></b> (0)</code> 
  <dd>The process priority to be assigned to the application instances (using 
    <code>setpriority()</code>). 
  <dt><code><b>-processSlack <em>n</em></b> (5)</code> 
  <dd>If the sum of the number of all currently running dynamic FastCGI applications 
    and <code>processSlack</code> exceeds <code>maxProcesses</code>, the process 
    manager invokes the killing policy. This is to improve performance at higher 
    loads by killing some of the most inactive application instances before reaching 
    <code>maxProcesses</code>. 
  <dt><code><b>-restart</b> (none)</code> 
  <dd>Causes the process manager to restart dynamic applications upon failure 
    (similar to static applications). 
  <dt><code><b>-restart-delay <em>n</em></b> (5 seconds)</code> 
  <dd>The minimum number of seconds between the respawning of failed instances 
    of applications. This delay prevents a broken application from soaking up 
    too much of the system. 
  <dt><code><b>-singleThreshold <em>n</em></b> (0)</code> 
  <dd>An integer between 0 and 100 used to determine whether the last instance 
    of a FastCGI application can be terminated. If the process manager computed 
    load factor for the application is lower than the specified threshold, the 
    last instance is terminated. In order to make your executables run in the 
    "idle" mode for the long time, you would specify a value closer to 1, however 
    if memory or CPU time is of primary concern, a value closer to 100 would be 
    more applicable. A value of 0 will prevent the last instance of an application 
    from being terminated; this is the default value, changing it is not recommended 
    (especially if <code>-appConnTimeout</code> is set). <br>
    For historic reasons the mis-spelling <code>singleThreshhold</code> is also 
    accepted. 
  <dt><code><b>-startDelay <em>n</em></b> (3 seconds)</code> 
  <dd>The number of seconds the web server waits patiently while trying to connect 
    to a dynamic FastCGI application. If the interval expires, the process manager 
    is notified with hope it will start another instance of the application. The 
    <code>startDelay</code> must be less than <code>appConnTimeout</code> to be 
    effective. 
  <dt><code><b>-updateInterval <em>n</em></b> (300 seconds)</code> 
  <dd>The updateInterval determines how often statistical analysis is performed 
    to determine the fate of dynamic FastCGI applications.

    <p>The <code>FastCgiExternalServer</code> directive defines <em>filename</em> 
      as an external FastCGI application. If <EM>filename</EM> does not begin 
      with a slash (/) then it is assumed to be relative to the <a
  href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</a>. The 
      <EM>filename</EM> does not have to exist in the local filesystem. URIs that 
      Apache resolves to this <EM>filename</EM> will be handled by this external 
      FastCGI application.. </p>
    <p>External FastCGI applications are not started by the process manager, they 
      are presumed to be started and managed "external" to Apache and mod_fastcgi. 
      The FastCGI devkit provides a simple tool, <code>cgi-fcgi</code>, for starting 
      FastCGI applications independent of the server (applications can also be 
      <i>self-starting</i>, see the devkit).</p>
    <p><em>Option</em> can be one of (case insensitive):</p>
  <dt><code><b>-appConnTimeout <em>n</em></b> (0 seconds)</code> 
  <dd><b>Unix:&nbsp</b>The number of seconds to wait for a connection to the FastCGI 
    application to complete or 0 to indicate a blocking <code>connect()</code> 
    should be used. Blocking <code>connect()</code>s have an OS dependent internal 
    timeout. If the timeout expires, a SERVER_ERROR results. For non-zero values, 
    this is the amount of time used in a <code>select()</code> to write to the 
    file descriptor returned by a non-blocking <code>connect()</code>. Non-blocking 
    <code>connect()</code>s are troublesome on many platforms. See also <code>-idle-timeout</code>, 
    it produces similar results but in a more portable manner.<br>
    <b>Windows NT:&nbsp;</b>TCP based applications work as above. Named pipe based 
    applications (static applications configured without the <code>-port</code> 
    option and dynamic applications) use this value successfully to limit the 
    amount of time to wait for a connection (i.e. it's not "troublesome"). By 
    default, this is 90 seconds (FCGI_NAMED_PIPE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT in mod_fastcgi.h). 
  <dt><code><b>-idle-timeout <em>n</em></b> (30 seconds)</code> 
  <dd>The number of seconds of FastCGI application inactivity allowed before the 
    request is aborted and the event is logged (at the <code>error</code> <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#loglevel"><code>LogLevel</code></a>). 
    The inactivity timer applies only as long as a connection is pending with 
    the FastCGI application. If a request is queued to an application, but the 
    application doesn't respond (by writing and flushing) within this period, 
    the request will be aborted. If communication is complete with the application 
    but incomplete with the client (the response is buffered), the timeout does 
    not apply. 
  <dt><code><b>-flush</b> (none)</code> 
  <dd>Force a write to the client as data is received from the application. By 
    default, <code>mod_fastcgi</code> buffers data in order to free the application 
    as quickly as possible. 
  <dt><code><b>-host <em>hostname:port</em></b> (none)</code> 
  <dd>The hostname or IP address and TCP port number (1-65535) the application 
    uses for communication with the web server. The <code>-socket</code> and <code>-host</code> 
    options are mutually exclusive. 
  <dt><code><b>-pass-header <em>header</em></b> (none)</code> 
  <dd>The name of an HTTP Request Header to be passed in the <i>request</i> environment. 
    This option makes available the contents of headers which are normally not 
    available (e.g. Authorization) to a CGI environment. 
  <dt><code><b>-socket<em> filename</em></b> (none)</code> 
  <dd><b>Unix:&nbsp;</b>The filename of the Unix domain socket the application 
    uses for communication with the web server. The filename is relative to the 
    <code><A href="#FastCgiIpcDir">FastCgiIpcDir</A></code>. The <code>-socket</code>

    <p>The <code>FastCgiWrapper</code> directive is used to enable support for 
      a wrapper such as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html">suexec</a> 
      (included with Apache in the support directory) or <a href="http://cgiwrap.sourceforge.net/">cgiwrap</a>. 
      To use the same wrapper used by Apache, set <code>FastCgiWrapper</code> 
      to <em>On</em> (NOTE - mod_fastcgi cannot reliably determine the wrapper 
      used by Apache when built as a DSO). The <i>On</i> argument requires suexec 
      be enabled in Apache (for CGI). To use a specific wrapper, specify a <em>filename</em>. 
      If the filename does not begin with a slash (/) then it is assumed to be 
      relative to the <a
  
  href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#serverroot" 
 >ServerRoot</a>. The wrapper is used to invoke all FastCGI applications (in the 
      future this directive will have directory context).</p>
    <p>When <code>FastCgiWrapper</code> is enabled, no assumptions are made about 
      the target application and thus presence and permissions checks cannot be 
      made. This is the responsibility of the wrapper.</p>
    <p>The wrapper is invoked with the following arguments: username, group, application. 
      The username and group are determined as described below. The application 
      is the &quot;filename&quot; Apache resolves the requested URI to (dynamic) 
      or the filename provided as an argument to another FastCGI (server or authorizer) 
      directive. These arguments may or may not be used by the wrapper (e.g. suexec 
      uses them, cgiwrap parses the URI and ignores them). The environment passed 
      to the wrapper is identical to the environment passed when a wrapper is 
      not in use.</p>
    <p>When <code>FastCgiWrapper</code> is enabled, the location of static or 
      external FastCGI application directives can be important. They inherit their 
      user and group from the <code>User</code> and <code>Group</code> of the 
      virtual server in which they were defined. <code>User</code> and <code>Group</code> 
      directives should precede FastCGI application definitions. Note that this 
      does <em>not</em> limit the FastCGI application to the virtual server in 
      which they were defined, the application is allowed to service requests 
      from any virtual server with the same user and group. If a request is received 
      for a FastCGI application without an existing matching definition running 
      with the correct user and group, a dynamic instance of the application is 
      started with the correct user and group. This can lead to multiple copies 
      of the same application running with different user/group. If this is a 
      problem, preclude navigation to the application from other virtual servers 
      or configure the virtual servers with the same User and Group.</p>

      you fully understand the security implications).</p>
