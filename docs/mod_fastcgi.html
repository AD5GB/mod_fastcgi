<h1>Module mod_fastcgi</h1>

This module is contained in the <code>mod_fastcgi.c</code> file, and
is not compiled into the server by default.
To use <code>mod_fastcgi</code> you first copy
<code>src/mod_fastcgi.c</code> from this kit into your Apache server's
source directory. Then you add the following line to the server build
Configuration file:
<pre>
        Module fastcgi_module    mod_fastcgi.o
</pre>
<p>
FastCGI provides a high-performance alternative to CGI for writing Web
server applications in a variety of languages, including Perl, C, C++,
Java, and Python.  FastCGI gets its speed by having keeping
application processes running between requests. So, unlike CGI, you do
not have the overhead of starting up a new process and doing
application initialization (e.g. connecting to a database) each time
somebody requests a document.<p>

FastCGI applications communicate with a Web server using a simple
communications protocol.  A single full-duplex connection communicates
the environment variables and <code>stdin</code> data to the
application, and <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> data to
the Web server.  An application can reside on a different
machine from the Web server, allowing applications to scale beyond
a single box and providing easier integration with existing systems.<p>

server modules and application libraries, go to the <A
HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/">FastCGI website
(http://www.fastcgi.com/)</A>.<p>



<h2>Summary</h2>

In order to configure FastCGI applications, you need a combination of
<code>mod_fastcgi</code> directives and other directives provided by
the Apache server.<p>

You use the
<code>AppClass</code> directive to start the FastCGI 
applications that you want to be managed by this Web server.  The
applications are managed in the sense that the server (a) logs an
error message when a managed process dies and (b) attempts to
restart managed processes that die.<p>

You use one or both of the
<code>AppClass</code> and <code>ExternalAppClass</code> directives
to define an association between a pathname and the connection 
information for a FastCGI application.  Connection
information is either the pathname of
a Unix domain socket or the IP address and port number of a
TCP port.  The difference between the two directives
is that a single <code>AppClass</code> 
directive both starts an application and sets up the association
for communicating with it, while <code>ExternalAppClass</code> only
defines the association.  In the case of <code>AppClass</code>,
the pathname used in the association is always the pathname of the
application's executable; with <code>ExternalAppClass</code> the pathname
is arbitrary.<p>

In order for an HTTP request to be processed by <code>mod_fastcgi</code>
the request's handler must be <code>fastcgi-script</code>
or the request's MIME type must be
<code>application/x-httpd-fcgi</code>.  Apache
provides several ways to set the handler and MIME type of
a request:

<ul>
  <li> <code>SetHandler</code> (in the context of a <code>Location</code>
         or <code>Directory</code> section or <code>.htaccess</code>
         file) can associate the handler
         <code>fastcgi-script</code> with
         a specific file, or all the files in a directory.<p>
  <li> <code>AddHandler</code> can associate the handler
         <code>fastcgi-script</code> with
         files based on file extension.<p>
  <li> <code>ForceType</code> (in the context of a <code>Location</code>
         or <code>Directory</code> section or <code>.htaccess</code>
         file) can associate the MIME type
         <code>application/x-httpd-fcgi</code> with
         a specific file, or all the files in a directory.<p>
  <li> <code>AddType</code> can associate the MIME type
         <code>application/x-httpd-fcgi</code> with
         files based on file extension.<p>
</ul>

Refer to the documentation for <code>mod_mime</code>
for more information on these directives, and to the documentation
of the Apache core features for information on <code>Location</code>
and <code>Directory</code> sections.<p>

<code>mod_fastcgi</code> handles requests as follows:

<ul>
  <li> <code>mod_fastcgi</code> retrieves the connection
        information associated with the requested pathname.
  <li> if no connection information is associated with the pathname, 
	the server returns <code>404 Not Found</code>.
  <li> <code>mod_fastcgi</code> connects to the FastCGI application process.
  <li> if the connection attempt fails, 
	the server returns <code>500 Server Error</code>.
  <li> <code>mod_fastcgi</code> transmits the request to the
        FastCGI application process, which generates a response.
  <li> <code>mod_fastcgi</code> receives the application's
        response and transforms
        it into an HTTP response.  The server sends
        this response back to the client.
</ul>

The configuration examples below show some valid ways to configure
<code>mod_fastcgi</code>.

<strong>Syntax:</strong> AppClass path-name

	           [-restart-delay N] [-priority N] 
	 	   [-port N] [-socket sock-name]
                   [-initial-env name=value]<br></em>
<strong>Context:</strong> srm.conf<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_fastcgi<p>

The <code>AppClass</code> directive starts one or more FastCGI
application processes, using the executable file
<code>path-name</code>.  Should any of these processes die, 
<code>mod_fastcgi</code> will write an error log entry and restart
the faulty process.<p>

The optional parameters to the <code>AppClass</code> directive
are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    <B>processes:</B> number of FastCGI processes that the Web server
    will spawn, default 1.<p>

  <li>
    <B>listen-queue-depth:</B> depth of listen queue
    shared by the processes, default 5.  A deeper listen queue
    allows the server to cope with transient
    load fluctuations without rejecting
    requests; it does not increase throughput.  Adding extra processes
    may increase throughput, depending upon the application and the
    host.<p>

  <li>
    <B>restart-delay:</B> number of seconds between restarts of
    processes in this class, default 5.  When the first process dies
    it will be restarted immediately, but if a second process from
    this class dies within <code>restart-delay</code> seconds, it will
    not be restarted until <code>restart-delay</code> seconds have
    passed since the previous restart.  This delay prevents a broken
    application from soaking up too much of the system.  Default value
    is 5 seconds.<p>

  <li>
    <B>priority:</B> priority of FastCGI application processes, as
    defined by the <code>setpriority</code> system call.  The default
    value is zero, i.e. same priority as the HTTP server.  Negative
    values are not allowed.<p>

  <li>
    <B>port:</B> TCP port number that the FastCGI application
    process will listen on.  Using this
    option makes the application accessible from the another
    machine (as well as from this one.)  An argument to the
    <code>port</code> option should be a number 
    between 1 and 65535.<p>

  <li>
    <B>socket:</B> pathname of the Unix domain socket that
    the FastCGI application process will listen on.  The
    module creates this socket within the directory
    specified by <code>FastCgiIpcDir</code>.  Using this option
    makes the application accessible to other Web servers or
    applications (e.g. <code>cgi-fcgi</code>) on the same machine
    or via multiple pathnames on this Web server
    (using <code>ExternalAppClass</code>.)
    If neither the <code>-socket</code> nor the <code>-port</code>
    options are given, the Web server generates a Unix domain
    socket name itself.<p>

  <li>
    <B>initial-env:</B> a name-value pair in the initial environment
    passed to the application processes.  The argument has the form
    <code>name=value</code>, with no whitespace allowed.
    You can add several name-value pairs to the initial environment
    by using this option several times.  The default
    initial environment is empty (no name-value pairs.)<p>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>-socket</code> and <code>-port</code> options are 
mutually exclusive.
<code>path-name</code>
must not equal the <code>path-name</code> supplied to an
earlier <code>AppClass</code> or <code>ExternalAppClass</code>
directive.  Other errors
possible in the <code>AppClass</code>
directive include syntax errors, arguments out of range, and the file
<code>path-name</code> being non-existent or not executable.

<A name="ExternalAppClass"><h2>ExternalAppClass</h2></A>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> ExternalAppClass path-name

	           [-socket sock-name]<br></em>
<strong>Context:</strong> srm.conf<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_fastcgi<p>

The <code>ExternalAppClass</code> directive provides a connection a
FastCGI application process that is listening to a specified TCP port 
or a UNIX domain socket.  <code>ExternalAppClass</code> is most commonly
used to communicate with a FastCGI application running on a different 
machine.  This directive implies nothing about how the FastCGI application
is managed (started, restarted, etc.).  <code>path-name</code>
simply provides an identifier for the connection.<p>

The optional parameters to the <code>ExternalAppClass</code> directive
are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    <B>host:</B> the host and port of the machine on which a FastCGI 
    process is running.  The argument should be a single string, 
    containing the host IP address (either as
    a hostname to be resolved via DNS or as a "dotted quad"
    such as "123.96.248.182"), followed by a colon (":"),
    followed by a port number
    (an integer between 1 and 65535.)<p>

  <li>
    <B>socket:</B> full pathname of a Unix Domain socket accessible
    from this Web server.  Most commonly, the FastCGI 
    application listening on this socket would have been started by an
    <code>AppClass</code> directive with the <code>-socket</code>
    option.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Exactly one of the <code>port</code> and <code>socket</code>
parameters must be supplied.  <code>path-name</code>
must not equal the <code>path-name</code> supplied to an
earlier <code>AppClass</code> or <code>ExternalAppClass</code>
directive.  Other
errors possible in the <code>ExternalAppClass</code>
directive include syntax errors and arguments out of range.
<p>


<A name="FastCgiIpcDir"><h2>FastCgiIpcDir</h2></A>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> FastCgiIpcDir dir-path<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> srm.conf<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_fastcgi<p>

The <code>FastCgiIpcDir</code> directive controls where
<code>mod_fastcgi</code> creates Unix-domain sockets
for communicating with the applications it manages.<p>

By default, <code>mod_fastcgi</code> creates
the sockets in <code>/tmp</code>.  The socket
names have the form <code>OM_WS_n.pid</code> where <code>n</code> is a
sequence number and <code>pid</code> is the process ID of the Apache
parent process.  If your system runs a periodic job to delete files
from <code>/tmp</code>, and it deletes these files, your Web
server won't be able to communicate with its FastCGI applications.<p>

To avoid this problem place a <code>FastCgiIpcDir</code> directive
before the <code>AppClass</code> directives in your server
configuration.  Specify a directory that's readable, writeable,
and searchable by the account you use for your Web server, but
otherwise not accessible to anyone.<p>

Note 1 below describes platform-specific problems
in moving the sockets out of <code>/tmp</code>; please read it.<p>

<strong>Context:</strong> srm.conf<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_fastcgi<p>

The <code>FCGIConfig</code> directive provides a set of configuration 
parameters that are used in governing the execution of the dynamic FastCGI
applications.  This includes limitations on process creation and
killing policy.  Current implementation of the latter computes a load
factor for each dynamic FastCGI application and makes the decision whether
to kill it or not based on the threshhold parameters specified above.
This directive has no affect on the statically configured 
(i.e. via AppClass) FastCGI applications.<p>

The optional parameters to the <code>FCGIConfig</code> directive
are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    <B>maxProcesses:</B> a maximum number of all dynamic FastCGI
    applications that are allowed to run on the system at any one time.
    Any attempt to start another copy of any dynamic FastCGI application
    will fail.  A single parameter that sets the limit of the number of
    processes has a default value of 50.<p>

  <li>
    <B>minProcesses:</B> a minimum number of the dynamic FastCGI
    applications that can be running on the system at any one time
    without being killed off by the process manager.  This
    value is used in the implementation of the killing policy for dynamic
    fastcgi applications and is used to reduce the response time during
    the spike of requests to FastCGI applications.  The default value for 
    this parameter is 5 processes.<p>

  <li>
    <B>maxClassProcesses:</B> a maximum number of instances of dynamic FastCGI 
    application that are allowed to run for any one FastCGI executable.  
    This value is used to limit the number of processes per each dynamic
    FastCGI application class.  The default value for this attribute is 
    10 processes.<p>

  <li>
    <B>killInterval:</B> a time value specified as a long which indicates
    how often the killing policy should be implemented by the process 
    manager.  The lower value would provide process manager invoking 
    killing policy at small time intervals, which would be ideal for sites
    that have a high number of requests to a large number of different 
    FastCGI applications.  A higher number would be ideal for sites with
    low number of requests and would result in process manager implementing
    a less aggressive policy.   The default value is 300 seconds.<p>

  <li>
    <B>updateInterval:</B> a long value that represents a time intervals 
    in which a statistical analysis should be made to determine the future
    state of the dynamic FastCGI applications.  This analysis designates 
    certain processes as VICTIMS and can be safely killed by the process 
    manager in its killing policy implementation.  The default value is 
    300 seconds.<p>

  <li>
    <B>gainValue:</B> a floating point value between 0 and 1 that is
    used as an exponent in the computation of the exponentially decayed
    connection times load factor of the currently running dynamic FastCGI
    application.  Old values are scaled by (1-<B>gainValue</B>), so making it
    smaller weights them more heavily compared to the current value,
    which is scaled by <B>gainValue</B>.  The default
    value for this attribute is 0.5.<p>

  <li>
    <B>singleThreshhold:</B> a integer between 1 and 100 that is used to 
    determine whether the last instance of the FastCGI application class 
    should be terminated.  If the process manager computed load factor for 
    the given application is lower than specified threshhold, the last
    instance is terminated.  In order to make your executables run in the 
    "idle" mode for the long time, you would specify value closer to 1, 
    however if memory or CPU time is of primary concern, value closer to 
    100 would be more applicable.  The default value is 10.<p>

  <li>
    <B>multiThreshhold:</B> a number between 1 and 100 that is used to 
    determine whether any one instance of the FastCGI application class
    should be terminated.  If the given applicaiton class has more than
    one instance currently running, this attribute will be used to decide
    whether one of them should be terminated and if only one instance 
    remains, <code>singleTHreshhold</code> is used.  The default value 
    for this attribute is 50.<p>

  <li>
    <B>startDelay:</B> an integer representing a number of seconds that 
    the web server waits in trying to connect to the FastCGI application.
    If the connection is unsuccessful within that time interval, a message
    CONN_TIMEOUT is sent to the process manager to invoke a new copy of the
    given FastCGI application.  The default value is 3 seconds.<p>

  <li>
    <B>appConnTimeout:</B> an integer representing a number of seconds that
    the web server spends trying to connect to FastCGI application.  If the
    connection is unsuccessful within that time interval, the web server 
    generates SERVER_ERROR response that is sent back to the client.  The
    provided value should be greater than the one specified by the 
    <code>startDelay</code> attribute.  The default value is 15 seconds.<p>

  <li>
    <B>processSlack:</B> a positive integer that represents a value that is
    used by the process manager in its killing policy.  If the sum of all 
    currently running FastCGI applications and <code>processSlack</code> 
    exceeds the value of <code>maxProcesses</code> attribute, a process 
    manager invokes the killing policy.  This measure is used to improve
    the performance at higher loads by killing extra processes prior to 
    achieving a highest possible load.  The value should reflect the value for
    <code>maxProcesses</code> and provided as a default of 5.<p>
</ul>
<p>
If you supply two or more different values for the same attribute of the
<code>FCGIConfig</code> directive, only the last value will be in effect.
Any attributes that have not been supplied will take on the default values
described above.  Possible sources of errors include syntax errors and
invalid arguments.

<h2>Important notes</h2>

<ol>

  <li>
    On some platforms, Unix-domain sockets don't work when stored
    in non-local file systems.  Digital UNIX 3.0 is known to have
    this problem with NFS (fixed in Digital UNIX 3.2);
    Solaris 2.5 is known to have this problem
    with AFS.  If <code>/tmp</code> is part of a local
    file system you'll avoid this problem by leaving the
    listening sockets in <code>/tmp</code> rather than using the
    <code>FastCgiIpcDir</code> directive to put them somewhere else.<p>

  <li>
    Error logging by the <code>mod_fastcgi</code> process manager
    corrupts the error log on some platforms, due to a bug in the C
    library function <code>fopen</code>.  For instance, SunOS 4.1.4
    has the <code>fopen</code> bug and exhibits the error log
    corruption problem.  A corrupted error log makes it difficult to
    debug problems on your Web server.  You should apply the following
    patch to Apache 1.1.1 in order to eliminate the possibility of
    this problem:

  <li>
    The <code>ScriptAlias</code> directive takes priority over the
    <code>AddType</code> directive: A file located in a directory that
    is the target of <code>ScriptAlias</code> is always
    handled by the handler <code>cgi-handler</code> (<code>mod_cgi</code>.)
    So don't put FastCGI applications in a <code>ScriptAlias</code>
    directory -- the applications won't work properly!<p>

  <li>
    The optional module <code>mod_env</code> provides two directives
    (<code>PassEnv</code> and <code>SetEnv</code>) that are designed
    for passing environment variables to CGI scripts.  These
    directives also work for passing per-request environment variables
    to FastCGI applications.  To pass initial environment variables
    you must use the <code>-initial-env</code> option to
    <code>AppClass</code>.<p>

  <li>
    <code>mod_fastcgi</code> does not implement the Authorizer or Filter
    roles described in the FastCGI specification.  However, you can
    approximate the Filter role using Apache's <code>Action</code>
    directive to route requests to a FastCGI Responder.
    See the documentation for <code>mod_actions</code> for information
    on the <code>Action</code> directive.<p>

  <li>
    For added security in executing FastCGI applications, you can

    Grossman.  This patch is available via

<h2>Notes on CGI response headers</h2>

You may have noticed that <code>mod_fastcgi</code> makes no
provision for non-parsed-header scripts.  There's a good reason for
this: <code>mod_fastcgi</code> does not restrict the functionality
of parsed-header scripts in any way.  A parsed-header script
can do anything that an "nph" script can do, and some things
that an "nph" script can't do.<p>

To exploit the power of parsed-header scripts you need
to understand the three standard CGI/1.1
response headers:<p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Status:</code> an HTTP status line, e.g.
      <code>"206 Partial Content"</code>.<p>
  <li><code>Location:</code> a URL or absolute path to content.<p>
  <li><code>Content-type:</code> the media type of script-generated
      response content.<p>
</ul>

Only certain combinations of these headers make sense:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Each header may appear at most once in a response.<p>
  <li>The <code>Status</code> and <code>Location</code> headers
      are mutually exclusive, i.e. at most one may appear
      in a response.  If neither appears, the effect
      is as if <code>Status: 200 OK</code> appeared, and
      a <code>Content-type</code> header must appear.<p>
  <li>A <code>Content-type</code> header means that
      the script will generate response content (e.g.
      an HTML document), and the
      absence of a <code>Content-type</code> header means
      that the script will not generate response content.<p>
  <li>A <code>Location</code> header may only be generated
      in response to a <code>GET</code> or <code>HEAD</code>
      request.<p>
</ul>

The <code>Location</code> header specifies a redirect.
There are two kinds.  If the <code>Location</code> value
is a full URL (e.g. <code>http://www.fastcgi.com/servers/apache</code>),
the effect is to generate an HTTP 302 response.  If the
<code>Location</code> value is an absolute path
(e.g. <code>/servers/apache</code>), the effect is to
execute a recursive request for that path within the server,
and return the response of that request.<p>

<code>Location</code> is optionally accompanied by
<code>Content-type</code>.  If the <code>Location</code> value
is a full URL and no <code>Content-type</code> is specified,
the Web server provides standardized content (of type
<code>text/html</code>); if a <code>Content-type</code> is specified,
the script provides the content.  If the <code>Location</code> value
is an absolute path then script-generated <code>Content-type</code> and
content are ignored.<p>

<code>mod_fastcgi</code> performs buffering of script-provided
content, but content is not allowed to linger in buffers
for more than a fraction of a second.  Therefore "server push"
scripts work correctly.<p>


<h2>Configuration example</h2>

What follows is a minimal httpd.conf for Apache 1.2 and FastCGI
Developer's Kit 1.5 (or higher).  Use this configuration for initial 
testing with FastCGI.  When you've verified that this configuration works,
you can merge the FastCGI-specific aspects of this configuration
with your own configuration.<p>

Directions:

<ol>
  <li>
    Change <code>$APACHE</code> to the path name of the directory
    containing your Apache 1.2 kit, i.e. the directory containing
    the Apache 1.2 README.  For instance, you might change
    <code>$APACHE</code> to <code>/udir/doe/apache_1.2</code>.<p>

    Change <code>$FASTCGI</code> to the path name of the directory
    containing your FastCGI Developer's Kit 1.5, i.e. the directory
    containing the FastCGI Developer's Kit 1.5 README.  For instance,
    you might change <code>$FASTCGI</code> to
    <code>/udir/doe/fcgi-devel-kit</code>.<p>

    Save the resulting file as <code>$APACHE/conf/httpd.conf</code>.<p>

  <li>
    Build Apache 1.2 with <code>mod_fastcgi</code>.  This creates the
    <code>httpd</code> executable.<p>
 
    Build the FastCGI Developer's Kit 1.5.  This creates the
    <code>echo</code> executable that you are going to run as a
    FastCGI application.<p>

  <li>
    In a shell, cd to <code>$APACHE</code> and start httpd:
    <pre>
    % src/httpd -f $APACHE/conf/httpd.conf
    </pre><p>

  <li>
    Use a browser to access the URL
    <pre>
    http://$YOUR_HOST:5556/examples/echo
    </pre>
    where <code>$YOUR_HOST</code> is the IP address of the host
    running httpd.  Look for <code>STATE=TEXAS</code> in the
    initial environment that <code>echo</code> displays.  The
    request counter should increment each time you reload the page.<p>
