# README for mod_fastcgi

**mod_fastcgi** is a module for the Apache web server, that enables
`FastCGI - a standards based protocol` for communicating with
applications that generate dynamic content for web pages.

**FastCGI** provides a superset of **CGI** functionality, but a subset of the
functionality of programming for a particular web server API.

Nonetheless, the feature set is rich enough for programming virtually
any type of web application, but the result is generally more
scalable.  

For more information on **FastCGI**, see on https://fastcgi-archives.github.io/

For information on **installing mod_fastcgi with Apache 1.3.x**, see the
file [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).

For information on **installing mod_fastcgi with Apache 2.x**, see the
