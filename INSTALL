             ***  Apache FastCGI Module Installation  ***


Notes
=====

  The FastCGI Module must be compiled into Apache.  If you have a binary
  only distribution of Apache, you must first obtain the Apache source
  (http://www.apache.org).

  The FastCGI Module has not been tested on all of the Apache supported
  platforms.  These are known to work: SunOS/Solaris, SCO, Linux, and
  QNX (Static Inet sockets only).  Windows will not work.  If your
  successful in using this module on other platforms, please email
  fastcgi-developers@idle.com.

  Please subscribe to fastcgi-announce@idle.com to receive notification
  of module updates.  Send comments, questions, or problems regarding
  FastCGI to fastcgi-developers@idle.com.  This is a forum for
  discussing not only the Apache FastCGI module, but also FastCGI
  applications.


Introduction
============

  As of Apache 1.3, there are two approaches to configure, compile, and
  install Apache.  

    o APACI - (Apache 1.3+) described in <apache_dir>/INSTALL

    o manual - (original) described in <apache_dir>/src/INSTALL.


Installing mod_fastcgi with APACI (Apache 1.3+)
===============================================

  1. Copy or move the mod_fastcgi distribution directory to
  <apache_dir>/src/modules/fastcgi.

  2. Specify "--activate-module=src/modules/fastcgi/libfastcgi.a" as an
  argument to ./configure from the <apache_dir> directory.  If you've
  previously used APACI to configure Apache, you can also specify this
  as an argument to ./config.status (Apache 1.3.1+) in order to
  preserve the existing configuration.

    <apache_dir>$ ./configure  \
                  --activate-module=src/modules/fastcgi/libfastcgi.a

    or

    <apache_dir>$ ./config.status  \
                  --activate-module=src/modules/fastcgi/libfastcgi.a

  3. Rebuild and reinstall Apache.

    <apache_dir>$ make
    <apache_dir>$ make install

  4. Edit the httpd configuration files to enable your FastCGI
  application(s).  See docs/mod_fastcgi.html for details.

  5. Restart the server.

    <apache_dir>$ /usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl stop
    <apache_dir>$ /usr/local/apache/sbin/apachectl start


Installing mod_fastcgi manually
===============================

  1. Copy or move the mod_fastcgi distribution directory to
  <apache_dir>/src/modules/fastcgi.

  2. Add the FastCGI module to <apache_dir>/src/Configuration.  Note that
  modules are listed in reverse priority order --- the ones that come
  later can override the behavior of those that come earlier.  I put mine
  just after mod_cgi entry.

    Apache 1.3+:
    
      AddModule modules/fastcgi/libfastcgi.a 

    Apache 1.2.X:

      Module fastcgi_module modules/fastcgi/libfcgi.a

  3. Copy the Makefile.sample to Makefile and edit if/as appropriate.

    <apache_dir>src$ cd modules/fastcgi
    <apache_dir>src$ cp Makefile.sample Makefile

  4. From the <apache_dir>/src directory, reconfigure and rebuild Apache.

    <apache_dir>/src$ ./Configure
    <apache_dir>/src$ make

  5. Apache 1.2 is designed to be configured and run from the same set of
  directories where it is compiled.  If your running Apache from a
  directory other than <apache_dir>/src (and not using links), you'll
  (of course) have to copy the new httpd to the <run_dir> directory.

    <apache_dir>/src$ cp httpd <run_dir>/bin/

  6. Edit the httpd configuration files to enable your FastCGI
  application(s).  See docs/mod_fastcgi.html for details.

  7. Restart the server.

    $ kill -TERM `cat <run_dir>/logs/httpd.pid`
    $ <run_dir>/bin/httpd	-f <run_dir>/conf/httpd.conf
